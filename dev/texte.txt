Discover
the EDEN EXPERIENCE

An in-situ art installation that morphs 
into an interactive theater experience.
Welcome to a universe where technology and mythology, 
mingle in the astral plane of consciousness...
Our story begins with Eve
right after her loss of innocence,
she learns from the Snake that another women
was the wife of Adam before her...
Lilith, created as equal to men,
refused to submit to Adam.
She ran away from Paradise and became Queen of the Succubi.
What follows is a massive multimedia allegory bringing classical theater and fantasy technologies together;

firedance, magical flight, musical bard
and Abyss from another world...
At any given time,
poor mortals can find sanctuary in the Eden Dome.

Beyond the performance,
the dome never cease to transform!
Founded in 2015 with the support of the OpenMind Project grant, the ''Eden Creative'' collective works in co-creation with inspiring festivals.
Eden Creative is a collective of Artists,
technicians, musicians, comedians, poets
and dreamers...


It's also a talented tribe of dedicated earthlings 
who know how to bring stories to life! 






See you soon, mortals...
